I think I did well with trying to come up with rules that would work for a variety of different user inputs. For instance if you were to say “I am mad” Eliza could say “I am glad that you are mad” or if you said “I love to eat burgers” Eliza could say “You love to eat burgers ?”. I also added multiple responses for some rules so that Eliza hopefully doesn’t say the same response for certain rules. I found the creation of the rules to be most interesting and challenging part of the project because it required a lot of thinking outside the box. You can easily come up with responses, but the challenge was whether the response was a good one or not and whether the response would fit in different types of conversations. I really wanted to add a feature where Eliza could remember what the user’s last sentence so that I could see if they repeated themselves. But, I realized this feature was more challenging than I expected in LISP. 

I believe that the poor conversation with Eliza was due to Eliza being limited to what rules you give her. It was hard to come up with rules that would not be based on specific conversations. My mindset when I started to create rules was that I wanted to create rules that would work for a variety of different conversation topics. As I began to write the rules, I noticed that some rules trumped others especially the keyword rules. I had to be very careful with those rules because some of the words have different meanings and used differently which would be some responses would not work. For instance, let’s say the keyword is like and the response is Why do you like < right side of matched sentence> ?; If I said “I like to go to ball games” Eliza would say, “Why do you like to go to ball games?”. But, if I said “An apple is like an orange” Eliza will get a poor response of “Why do you like an orange”. Even if you designed an enormous subset of rules, you would eventually get bad responses because the number of different types of conversations someone could have is infinite. 

Another problem I noticed is when you write sentences that have multiple key words or phrases that match rules. This caused Eliza send multiple responses in one sentence. For instance let’s say the database rule is “you are” and the response can either be “I am glad that I am <right side of matched sentence>” or the users sentence rephrased as a question. Well if you user’s sentence is “You are glad that you are an idiot” Eliza’s response would be either “I am glad that I am glad that I am an idiot” or “I am glad that I am an idiot?”. Obviously the later response isn’t as bad as the first, however they are both pretty bad responses. I tried to make it so that Eliza uses some of the user’s input to generate a response. As you can see, sometimes using the user’s input is not the best choice.


One of the biggest things I think that Eliza should be able to do is dynamically update her rules database as the conversation with the user goes on. By this I mean she feeds off the users input and is able to make rules based off what is said in the conversation. Dynamically updating her rules database should tremendously improve the conversations between Eliza and the user. Another great feature would be the ability to  store what is being said in the conversation. Having Eliza dynamically update her rules database would be great; However, if the information is not stored
